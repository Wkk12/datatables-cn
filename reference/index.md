# 概览

> This is a [Jekyll theme](https://github.com/allejo/jekyll-docs-theme) based on [mistic100's modification](https://github.com/mistic100/jekyll-bootstrap-doc) of the official Bootstrap documentation from a few years back.

Jekyll Docs Theme is provided as a theme for writing documentation for your projects instead of having a single large README file or several markdown files stored in a not so user-friendly manner.

This theme is still in development but is kept fairly stable; just note, there are a lot things yet to come.
